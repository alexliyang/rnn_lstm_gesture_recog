# rnn_lstm_gesture_recog
For recognising hand gestures using RNN and LSTM... Implementation in TensorFlow

In this git repo, there are 4 main files that represent the current implementation. Rest are for testing purposes. 
These 4 files can be copied for other implementations.

1) rnn_lstm_optimized.py --- This python script is the optimized implementation. It trains the model on the data and then tests the accuracy and records it.

2) rnn_lstm_train.py --- This python script file is for training the model on the data and then string the model and the graph in the folder Trained_model.
